# C++ Tutoring Assignment 1

This assignment is going to build on the brief look we took at classes last
week. It will cover some topics we haven't looked at yet,
such as _forking_ and _cloning_ repositories in Github, and some features of
C++ classes such as _constructors_.
If you get stuck, Google is your friend! (Message me if you get _really_
stuck).

**In this assignment, your task is to create and write `Car.h` and `Car.cpp`
so that the program in [main.cpp](https://github.com/kvsm/TutoringHW1/blob/master/TutoringHW1/main.cpp)
works and produces the following output in the console:**

```
You press the car's horn. HONK!
Testing the gears...
The car is in gear: 1
The car is in gear: 5
The car is in gear: 1
Checking the colour...
The car is green.
Respraying...
The car is red.
Press any key to continue . . .
```

1. _Fork_ this repository. This will create a copy (fork) of the repo in your own
account.
2. _Clone_ your fork to your local machine. (Github gives you instructions for this when 
3. Open the project in VS and complete the assignment.
4. _Commit_ your work in git locally, and _push_ your solution back up to
Github.

Good luck!
